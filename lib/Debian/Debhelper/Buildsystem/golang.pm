=head1 NAME

dh-golang -- debhelper build system class for Go packages

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The dh-golang package provides a build system for debhelper which can be used in
the following way:

 %:
 	dh $@ --buildsystem=golang --with=golang

=head1 IMPLEMENTATION

Here is a brief description of how the golang build system implements each
debhelper build system stage:

=over

=item B<configure>

Creates a Go workspace (see https://golang.org/doc/code.html#Workspaces) in the
build directory. Copies the source code into that workspace and symlinks all
available libraries from /usr/share/gocode/src into the workspace because the
go(1) tool requires write access to the workspace. See also
C<DH_GOLANG_INSTALL_EXTRA> and C<DH_GOLANG_INSTALL_ALL>.

=item B<build>

Determines build targets (see also C<DH_GOLANG_BUILDPKG> and
C<DH_GOLANG_EXCLUDES>), possibly calls C<go generate> (see also
C<DH_GOLANG_GO_GENERATE>), then calls C<go install>.

=item B<test>

Calls C<go test -v> on all build targets.

=item B<install>

Installs binaries and sources from the build directory into the Debian package
destdir. See also C<--no-source> and C<--no-binaries>.

=item B<clean>

Removes the build directory.

=back

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item B<dh_auto_install>

=over

=item B<--no-source>

By default, all files within the src/ subdirectory of the build directory will
be copied to /usr/share/gocode/src/ of the Debian package destdir. Specifying
the C<--no-source> option disables this behavior, which is useful if you are
packaging a program (as opposed to a library).

Example (in C<debian/rules>):

 override_dh_auto_install:
 	dh_auto_install -- --no-source

=item B<--no-binaries>

By default, all files within the bin/ subdirectory of the build directory will
be copied to /usr/bin/ of the Debian package destdir. Specifying the
C<--no-binaries> option disables this behavior.

Example (in C<debian/rules>):

 override_dh_auto_install:
 	dh_auto_install -- --no-binaries

Note: instead of using this option (which was added for symmetry with
C<--no-source>), consider not building unwanted binaries in the first place to
save CPU time on our build daemons; see C<DH_GOLANG_EXCLUDES>.

=back

=head1 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

=over

=item C<DH_GOPKG>

C<DH_GOPKG> (string) contains the Go package name which this Debian package is
building.

C<DH_GOPKG> is automatically set to the value of the first import path of the
C<XS-Go-Import-Path> C<debian/control> field, which can contain several
comma-separated import paths.

Example (in C<debian/control>):

 XS-Go-Import-Path: github.com/go-mgo/mgo,
                    gopkg.in/mgo.v2,
                    labix.org/v2/mgo,
                    launchpad.net/mgo

Historical note: before the C<XS-Go-Import-Path> field was introduced, we used
to set C<DH_GOPKG> in C<debian/rules>. When you encounter such a package, please
convert it by moving the value from C<debian/rules> to C<debian/control>. It is
preferable to use the C<debian/control> field because it is machine-readable and
picked up/used by various Debian infrastructure tools, whereas C<debian/rules> is
very hard to parse.

=item DH_GOLANG_INSTALL_EXTRA

C<DH_GOLANG_INSTALL_EXTRA> (list of strings, whitespace-separated, default
empty) enumerates files and directories which are additionally installed into
the build directory. By default, only files with the following extension are
installed: .go, .c, .cc, .h, .hh, .proto, .s.

Example (in C<debian/rules>):

 export DH_GOLANG_INSTALL_EXTRA := html/charset/testdata html/testdata \
    bpf/testdata

=item DH_GOLANG_INSTALL_ALL

C<DH_GOLANG_INSTALL_ALL> (bool, default false) controls whether all files are
installed into the build directory. By default, only files with the following
extension are installed: .go, .c, .cc, .h, .hh, .proto, .s.

Example (in C<debian/rules>):

 export DH_GOLANG_INSTALL_ALL := 1

Note: prefer the C<DH_GOLANG_INSTALL_EXTRA> environment variable because it is
self-documenting and future-proof: when using C<DH_GOLANG_INSTALL_ALL>, readers
of your package cannot easily tell which extra files in particular need to be
installed, and newer upstream versions might result in unexpected extra files.

=item DH_GOLANG_BUILDPKG

C<DH_GOLANG_BUILDPKG> (list of strings, whitespace-separated, default
C<${DH_GOPKG}/...>) defines the build targets for compiling this Go package. In
other words, this is what will be passed to C<go install>.

The default value matches all Go packages within the source, which is usually
desired, but you might need to exclude example programs, for which you should
use the C<DH_GOLANG_EXCLUDES> environment variable.

Example (in C<debian/rules>):

 # Install only programs for end users, the also-included Go packages are not
 # yet mature enough to be shipped for other packages to consume (despite what
 # upstream claims).
 export DH_GOLANG_BUILDPKG := github.com/debian/ratt/cmd/...

=item DH_GOLANG_EXCLUDES

C<DH_GOLANG_EXCLUDES> (list of Perl regular expressions, whitespace-separated,
default empty) defines regular expression patterns to exclude from the build
targets expanded from C<DH_GOLANG_BUILDPKG>.

Example (in C<debian/rules>):

 # We want to ship only the library packages themselves, not the accompanying
 # example binaries.
 export DH_GOLANG_EXCLUDES := examples/

=item DH_GOLANG_GO_GENERATE

C<DH_GOLANG_GO_GENERATE> (bool, default false) controls whether C<go generate>
is called on all build targets (see C<DH_GOLANG_BUILDPKG>).

It is convention in the Go community to commit all C<go generate> artifacts to
version control, so re-generating these artifacts is usually not required.

Depending on what the Go package in question uses C<go generate> for, you may
want to enable C<DH_GOLANG_GO_GENERATE>:

=over

=item *

If the Go package uses C<go generate> to generate artifacts purely from inputs
within its own source (e.g. creating a perfect hash table), there usually is no
need to re-generate that output. It does not necessarily hurt, either, but some
C<go generate> commands might be poorly tested and break the build.

=item *

If the Go package uses C<go generate> to (e.g.) bundle a JavaScript library into
a template file which is then compiled into a Go program, it is advisable to
re-generate that output so that the Debian version of the JavaScript library is
picked up, as opposed to the pre-generated version.

=back

Example (in C<debian/rules>):

 export DH_GOLANG_GO_GENERATE := 1

Note: this option should default to true, but it was introduced after dh-golang
was already widely used, and nobody made the transition happen yet (i.e. inspect
and possibly fix any resulting breakages).
